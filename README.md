# FÃ¸rstegangstjeneste A-B-C (First Service)
My first Android APP I ever published. During my first year in the Norwegian Army, I was always looking for some help or guidelines for what to do. It was so much to learn on so little time. There where no text books, or easy tricks to remeber everything. And all the information where scattered everywhere. <br />
<br />
I then decided why not try to make something, that will make the life easier for the people who comes after me. And so this APP where created. A multi tool to get started with the most basic soilder traning. It is still active on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suxsx.firstservice">google play</a> and are in daily use. I still meet people who have been in the army recently and downloaded the APP. Most of the content are proboly to old now, but still it is a good memory to look back on. I decied to publish the code for it so people and take what they need if there are anything they need and create something new or better. I havent had the chance to upgrade it for years so if somebody wants to use it for something better be my guest, but please include my name in it. <br />
<br />
I hope it can do something good.
